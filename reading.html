            <b>1.What would be a good definition of how any kind of artist can use an algorithm in their art? </b><br>
An artist uses algorithms when they are following a set of guidelines in order to achieve a desired look. <br><br>

            <b>2. Give some examples of how you might already use algorithms in your own artwork.</b><br>
When I paint, I use an algorithm to achieve a specific texture. For example: smooth, rocky, or a choppy texture can be done by using different paint brushes or knives. You can also say that I use an algorithm during the process of painting the background first and working your way to the foreground. <br><br>

            <b>3.Look at the four artist above and please describe for each one, ‘where’ you think the art is and how could you talk about the process of the art versus the art ‘artifact’. For example, if an artist is using computers to generate art, where is the art? Is it in the software program or the product it makes?</b><br>
I think that art drives from creativity, therefore if a person created a software program that's designed to create paintings, then the creative person is the artist and the art is their software. The paintings created by his art can be duplicated identically, therefore eliminating the uniqueness that is art. <br><br>

            <b>4. What is an example of an artist that has an iconic style to you? Please summarize a basic ‘ingredients’ list and process that might create their style.</b><br>
Vincent Van Gogh has an algorithm because while most of his paintings look very different, they all carry on a similar trait; his signature brush strokes.

            <b>I read some basic instrutions and rewrote it as if I were to be instructing a robot  </b>
<b>Original Recipe for making a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwhich</b><br>

How To Make Tea (original recipe)
Heat up water
Pour water into a tea cup
Put tea bag inside the cup with hot water
If desire, add sugar

<br><br>

            <b>If you are a robot and want to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, please follow these steps:</b><br>

Identify the refrigerator
Travel toward the refrigerator, going around obstacles 
Open the refrigerator door
Identify the jelly and the the bread
Clasp both the jelly and the bread
Leave the jelly and the bread on the counter and close the refrigerator door
Identify the cabinet with the peanut butter
Travel toward the cabinet and open it
Identify the peanut butter and pull it out of the cabinet
Place the peanut butter next to the jelly and the bread
Find a plate and a knife and place it on the same counter
Open the bread bag and pull out two slices
Place the slices on the plate
Grab the jelly and twist the lid, removing the lid
Place the knife inside the jar and scoop some jelly out
Spread the peanut jelly evenly on one of the slices of bread by moving the knife side to side
 Grab the peanut butter and twist the lid, removing the lid
Place the knife inside the jar and scoop some peanut butter out
Spread the peanut butter knife evenly on one of the slices of bread by moving the knife side to side
 Place the peanut butter slice face down on top of the jelly slice
Cut it in half
Hand it to a human to enjoy
<br><br>


            <b>Abstract Recipe on How to Make Tea, If You Are a Robot</b><br>
Robots do not drink tea
Do not attempt to drink the tea, this will most likely cause a malfunction
Find a human who desires tea
Why would a human drink this stuff?
Ask the human that question
But why would they drink it?
Continue asking this question and disregarding the response
Eventually, the human will get frustrated with your question
The human will get up and make their own damn tea
It works every time
<br><br>






            <b>Rules to instruct a robot to do anything:</b>
Confirm that your robot is familiar with its surroundings
Program the robot to remember how to do several steps so that you don’t have to repeat the steps all over again (like I did for step 16 and 19)
Ensure that you tell your robot what tools it will be using to execute an action
Make sure you tell your robot where it can find objects it needs
Program your robot to know what object look like so it can identify them when sighted 
Program your robot to know the texture and delicacy of objects so that it does not apply unnecessary force

            <b>1. Given the Wikipedia definitions on data and informations, what is your own take on this and specify what is the difference between data and information.</b><br>
		According to Wikipedia, data means “ a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables”. Information, according to Wikipedia, means “any entity or form that resolves uncertainty or provides the answer to a question of some kind”.  I think the difference between the two is that data can be broken down into parts while information is the understanding of a collected data.  <br><br>

<b>2.From the Manovich reading, what is the difference between visualization and mapping?</b><br>
    Manovich describes visualization as something that is visually represented while mapping is the documentation of data. The difference between the two is that visualization (noun) is when something is presented visually and mapping (verb) is the process of organizing the data. <br><br>

<b>3.When Manovich states that visualization is the anti-sublime art, what is he referring to? Do you agree with this  notion?</b><br>
            When Manovich mentions that visualization is the “anti-sublime art” he means to take something that is mean to be represented as unreal and represented as something that is understandable and real. <br><br>

            <b>4.When Manovich remarks on the ‘dark-side’ of mapping, what is he referring to?</b><br>
To Manovich, the  “dark-side” of mapping is the ability to map chaos without really understanding what its composed of. <br><br>

            <b>Laurie Frick</b><br>
            Frick was an engineer who became an artist later in life. She created a device that is attached to a person’s head to monitor their sleep patterns. By doing this, she used (B) Data as Process and Exploration and she also (E) experimented in self-surveillance. Zeo, the company that makes Fitbits, admired her work and contacted her and asked if she would like help to analyse and process the data. By agreeing to this, she was able to further perfect her work by (A) Crowd Sourcing with Zeo.  She then took the data that she gathered and organized it into a visual map that she calls art.  Laurie’s ability to take scientific data and turn it into something interactive and applicable is something to take seriously because it could help millions of people change the way they monitor their sleep habits.   <br><br>
            <b>Feltron</b><br>
He gathered lots of data on his own life and experience. Using scanned images of documents he saved, he was able to plot graphs of data using the documents and images of dates and important life events. Using the graphs he was able to come up with an algorithm that generated images that he calls art. These images are very abstract in form and don’t really follow any kind of naturally occurring organic shapes. He is good at creating data narratives. He creates a map to record the his father’s life experience in his life spans by collecting the data from passports, calendars, photos, leftover documents, address, receipts, EKG report, etc.

  <b>Koblin</b><br>
  Aaron Koblin and his team work at Google where they used various programs throughout there time there. During his keynote he showed off different projects including the The Johnny Cash Project and Wilderness Downtown which used Arcade Fire. His work are forms of internet art. In the Cash project, people were sent different frames from archives of Johnny Cash and they would then draw out the said scene using the tools provided to them on the site. When it was brought all together, it rolled through everyone’s individual art showing everyone’s contribution to the project helping bringing fans of different backgrounds together based on their one common interest. With this project, it helps contribute to F. Platforms and Virtual Communities as well as G. Creating Data Narratives. While using A. Crowd Sourcing to get people to come together to help contribute.
